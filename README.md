# nooBO : Beginner-friendly Bayesian Optimization
> Run BoTorch based Bayesian Optimization with (almost) a single line of code

## Nota Bene
nooBO is made for beginners, it wraps-up the few lines of code required to perform basic Bayesian Optimization using [`BoTorch`](https://botorch.org/), while automatically storing important metrics with [`Tensorboard`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard?hl=en) for easy vizualisation. With a couple of lines of code, it enables solving continuous optimization problems in a space whose dimensionality is preferably under 50. For full-fledged research/engineering, it is best to use [`BoTorch`](https://botorch.org/) directly.  

## Installation
First install required dependencies.
```bash
pip install torch botorch tensorboard
```
Then clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Matperrin-ds/nooBO.git
```
## Usage

## Vizualising optimization metrics
